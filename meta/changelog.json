  "changelog": "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Currently, this project is using an `0.x` versioning system to indicate its preview status. As such, it does _not_ currently adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Once we reach production readiness, we will follow semver beginning with our `1.0` release. In the meantime, please read this changelog for information on breaking changes!\n\n## 0.14.0 [January 17, 2019]\n\n### Added\n\n- Tooltip: Use react-popper instead of a custom solution [#1371]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- ResourceList: Fix item being undefined on onClick and onItemClick, fix onItemClick being fired on action onClick [#1443]\n\n## 0.13.0 [January 14, 2019]\n\n### Added\n\n- Form.Field: Implement new API based on RFC [#1287]\n- Release proces: add quick guide [#1397]\n- Testing: Test event handlers [#1311]\n- Added missing icons [#1406]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- IE 11 fix: Use insertBefore instead of prepend in global style injection [#1412]\n- Form.Label: Replaces the default value to be an empty string [#1411]\n- Sidebar: Add object branch presence check [#1420][#1423]\n- Page Header: Fixed link hover and added stories [#1409]\n- Radio: Fix onChange callback firing twice [#1403]\n- Icon: Re-uploaded user-add icon [#1428]\n- Pager: Do not enforce totals [#1404]\n\n### Internal\n\n- Adds StackLayout [#1363]\n\n## 0.12.2 [January 9, 2019]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Icon: Add ‚Äúapplication‚Äù icon. [#1401]\n- Alternate implementation for uniqueId: This improves snapshot testing experience by removing random hashes from components attributes. [#1374] (Warning: You may need to update some snapshots and remove any uniqueId mock.)\n- Breadcrumb: Fix automation attribute naming. [#1309] (Warning: You may need to update some tests.)\n\n**Breadcrumb change**\n\nWe have renamed the Breadcrumb.Link automation attribute from this:\n`<a data-cosmos-key=\"link\">clicky</a>`\nto this:\n`<a data-cosmos-key=\"breadcrumb.link\">clicky</a>`\n\nPlease update your tests (if any) accordingly.\n\n**UniqueId helper change**\n\nIn the past, we used to randomly generate an id for some attributes that were required to link components.\nNow we're using a global counter, which will lead to improve snapshot testing since each test is run in an isolated environment, and then each test run will have a fresh and pure start.\n\nIf you were using a mock for `uniqueId` as a workaround:\n\n```js\njest.mock('../../../core/components/_helpers/uniqueId', () => () => 'abcdef1234')\n```\n\nPlease, remove it since is no longer needed.\n\n## 0.12.1 [January 8, 2019]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Radio: Fixed rendering of label [#1393]\n\n## 0.12.0 [January 7, 2019]\n\n### Added\n\n- Testing: Custom prop tests [#1308][#1312]\n- ResourceList: Adds a prop to set the width to the resource list body [#1314]\n- Image: Images are now responsive by default [#1244]\n- Image: Added fit properties to scale images to a container proportionally [#1244]\n- Avatar: Images in avatar fit to cover the container.
